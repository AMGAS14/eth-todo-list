# eth-todo-list


A first blockchain application!

A todo list powered by Ethereum smart contracts. 



First, we'll create a smart contract with the Solidity programming language. 

Then, we'll write tests against the smart contract, and deploy it to a blockchain. 

Finally, we'll create a client side application to for the todo list.
